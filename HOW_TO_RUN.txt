Steps

1. Create an empty directory on your machine and download the 'Dockerfile' to it

2. Build a docker image using the following command. This will also run the code that generates the solution and will commit it to the image.
        docker build -t iHeart:solution .

3. Start a container and attach to it using the following command
        docker run --rm -it iheart:solution /bin/bash

4. You can use 'vi' editor to view the already generated solution in the following files
            /root/avg_number_of_fields.txt
            /root/value_WordCount.csv
            /root/total_number_of_rows.txt

        ex: vi /root/avg_number_of_fields.txt

5. The code that generates the solution can be viewed in the following script
            /root/solution.py
